The LilNouns ENS project takes security seriously. This document outlines our security policies, vulnerability reporting procedures, and security best practices for contributors and users.

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.x.x   | :x: (Legacy)       |

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Responsible Disclosure

If you discover a security vulnerability in the LilNouns ENS project, please follow our responsible disclosure process:

**DO:**
- Report vulnerabilities privately via email to: **security@lilnouns.wtf**
- Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
- Allow reasonable time for our team to respond and address the issue
- Work with us to verify and understand the impact

**DO NOT:**
- Create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
- Disclose vulnerabilities publicly before they are addressed
- Exploit vulnerabilities for malicious purposes
- Access or modify data that doesn't belong to you

### What to Include in Your Report

Please provide as much information as possible to help us understand and reproduce the issue:

1. **Vulnerability Description**
   - Clear description of the vulnerability
   - Potential impact and severity assessment
   - Steps to reproduce the issue

2. **Technical Details**
   - Affected contract(s) and function(s)
   - Code snippets or proof of concept
   - Network/environment where discovered
   - Transaction hashes (if applicable)

3. **Suggested Fix** (if available)
   - Proposed solution or mitigation
   - Alternative approaches considered

4. **Contact Information**
   - Your preferred contact method
   - Timeline for public disclosure (if any)

### Response Timeline

We are committed to responding to security reports promptly:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of receiving the report
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Within 7 days of initial response
- **Fix Development**: Timeline depends on severity and complexity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed and verified

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Verify Contract Addresses**
   - Always verify contract addresses before interacting
   - Use official sources for contract addresses
   - Be cautious of phishing attempts

2. **Transaction Safety**
   - Review transaction details carefully before signing
   - Use hardware wallets for significant transactions
   - Verify gas fees and transaction parameters

3. **Private Key Security**
   - Never share your private keys or seed phrases
   - Use secure wallet software
   - Enable multi-factor authentication where possible

### For Developers

1. **Smart Contract Security**
   - Follow OpenZeppelin security patterns
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Validate all inputs and handle edge cases
   - Use reentrancy guards where appropriate

2. **Testing Requirements**
   - Write comprehensive unit tests
   - Include edge case and error condition tests
   - Perform integration testing with mock contracts
   - Use fuzz testing for critical functions

3. **Code Review Process**
   - All contract changes require security review
   - Use static analysis tools (Slither, Mythril)
   - Document security assumptions and trade-offs
   - Follow the principle of least privilege

## Security Architecture

### Smart Contract Security Features

1. **Access Control**
   - Role-based access control using OpenZeppelin AccessControl
   - Multi-signature requirements for critical operations
   - Time-locked administrative functions

2. **Upgrade Safety**
   - UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) pattern
   - Storage layout compatibility validation
   - Upgrade authorization mechanisms
   - Emergency pause functionality

3. **Input Validation**
   - Comprehensive parameter validation
   - Bounds checking for array operations
   - String length and format validation
   - Address validation and zero-address checks

4. **Reentrancy Protection**
   - OpenZeppelin ReentrancyGuard implementation
   - Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern
   - State updates before external calls

### Security Tools and Analysis

1. **Static Analysis**
   - **Slither**: Automated vulnerability detection
   - **Mythril**: Symbolic execution analysis
   - **Semgrep**: Pattern-based security scanning

2. **Testing Tools**
   - **Foundry**: Fuzz testing and property-based testing
   - **Hardhat**: Integration testing with mainnet forks
   - **Echidna**: Property-based testing (planned)

3. **Monitoring**
   - Contract event monitoring
   - Unusual transaction pattern detection
   - Gas usage anomaly detection

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Classification

**Critical (P0)**
- Immediate threat to user funds
- Contract compromise or exploit
- Private key exposure

**High (P1)**
- Potential fund loss scenarios
- Access control bypass
- Upgrade mechanism compromise

**Medium (P2)**
- Denial of service vulnerabilities
- Information disclosure
- Gas optimization attacks

**Low (P3)**
- Minor logic errors
- Documentation issues
- Non-security code quality issues

### Response Procedures

1. **Immediate Response (0-2 hours)**
   - Assess severity and impact
   - Activate incident response team
   - Consider emergency pause if necessary
   - Begin stakeholder communication

2. **Investigation (2-24 hours)**
   - Detailed vulnerability analysis
   - Impact assessment and user notification
   - Develop fix strategy
   - Coordinate with security researchers

3. **Resolution (24-72 hours)**
   - Deploy fixes to testnet
   - Comprehensive testing of fixes
   - Deploy to mainnet with verification
   - Post-incident analysis and documentation

4. **Post-Incident (1-2 weeks)**
   - Public disclosure (if appropriate)
   - Process improvements
   - Security audit updates
   - Community communication

## Security Audits
